# Paper-Unshredder
Unshred shredded paper using character matching and neural nets


This paper gives an overview of two different approaches that are able to assemble shredded paper strips back into a complete document. These solutions are categorized into two parts, one machine learning-based and the other is a puzzle approach that uses a basic approach to solve the problem. The paper will explain the whole trajectory that the data takes while being cleaned and processed to be fed as training data for the machine learning model and comparison data for the basic puzzle model. Further the results of both these approaches would be discussed and would be evaluated on complexity and efficiency.
